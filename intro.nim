started:
- when Dive Into Python (2000-2004) was one of the best resources to start with

(amplifon python project in 2016!)
- there were some scientific libraries that still did not support python 3 I believe...
- recall that f-strings came out in 3.6 (december 2016!), we use to use as reference https://pyformat.info/
- and my first time at a Python Milano meetup was... uh... 2018? 2017?
